My name is Joshua Lau, and I'm currently studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I'm interested in a wide range of topics, including full-stack development, computer networks, and NLP!

To contact me, my email is joshuamotoaki at the domain gmail.com.

## Technologies & Tools
I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript (usually with Svelte or React for the frontend) and Dart/Flutter for my personal projects, and C and Python for my research. I am familiar with Go, Verilog, Java, MatLab, and ARM Assembly through my coursework. In terms of backend development, I primarily use PostgreSQL for databases and Node.js for the server.
