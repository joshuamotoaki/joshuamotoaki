Hi! I'm Joshua Motoaki Lau (劉元明), and I'm the founder & CEO of [Kizaki](https://kizaki.ai), an early-stage startup building the platform for personal software. Join our waitlist at [the website](https://kizaki.ai)!


I'm also a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Princeton University, minoring in computer science. I research computer networks and AI with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/). I also work as chief software engineer for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/), a 41-member student organization that builds open-source web apps for the Princeton community.

## Selected Projects

- [Titrate](https://github.com/AnnZhouCcc/Titrate) — An algorithm in network routers to maximize throughout and minimize latency through buffer sizing without making assumptions about the underlying network traffic (paper to appear at NSDI '26).
- [TigerJunction](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-junction) — A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection used by most Princeton undergraduates. I now mentor a team of students to improve the app (part of TigerApps).
- [GenCards](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/gen-cards) — A desktop flashcard application that features a take on spaced repetition that I believe is more human-friendly. Not really worked on anymore, but I hope to eventually return to the concept.
