ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Joshua Lau, and I'm currently studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I research computer networks with Prof. Maria Apostolaki with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/), looking specifically into video streaming security. I'm interested in a wide range of topics, including full-stack development, computer networks, and natural language processing! 

My email is joshuamotoaki@gmail.com.

## ðŸš€ Projects
- **TigerJunction**: A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection.
- **UnboundCSE**: A free, online textbook for learning introductory computer science and electrical engineering.
- **HiraHero**: A web-based tool for practicing typing on East Asian language keyboards.
 
## ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools
I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript (usually with Svelte or React for the frontend) and Dart/Flutter for my personal projects, and C and Python for my research. I am familiar with Go, Verilog, Java, MatLab, and ARM Assembly through my coursework. For backend development, I primarily use PostgreSQL for databases and Node.js for the server.
