I lead the [Kizaki](https://kizaki.app) project, which seeks to reimagine knowledge management and human-AI interaction with a programmable multimedia interface. Join the waitlist on the website!

I'm a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Princeton University, minoring in computer science. I research computer networks and AI with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/). I also work as co-president and chief software engineer for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/), a 41-member student organization that builds open-source web apps for the Princeton community.

## Selected Projects

- [Kizaki](https://kizaki.app) - A collaborative, multimedia, cross-device knowledge management platform where users can build their own interfaces utilizing a custom programming framework (and AI) which makes building high-quality web apps easy. (releasing soon!)
- [TigerJunction](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-junction) — A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection used by most Princeton undergraduates. I now mentor a team of students to improve the app (part of TigerApps).
- [GenCards](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/gen-cards) — A desktop flashcard application that features a take on spaced repetition that I believe is more human-friendly. Not really worked on anymore, but I hope to eventually return to the concept.
