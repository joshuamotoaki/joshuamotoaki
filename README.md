I'm a third year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Princeton University, minoring in computer science. I research computer networks and security with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/). I also work as co-president and chief software engineer for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/), a student organization that builds and maintains open-source web and mobile apps for the Princeton community. 

## Projects
My project work focuses on creating scalable web apps that people want to use — ensuring that design principles are used for both architecting robust computer systems and seamless user experiences. Some of my favorites:

- [TigerJunction](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-junction) — A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection used by thousands of students.
- [GenCards](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/gen-cards) — A desktop flashcard application that features a take on spaced repetition that I believe is more human-friendly.
- [TigerStudy](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-study-2) — A simple web app that helps Princeton students find study groups for their courses.
