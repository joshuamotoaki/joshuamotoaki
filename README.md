😊 Hi there! I'm Joshua Motoaki Lau, and I'm currently studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I research computer networks with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/), specifically looking into video streaming security. I also work as a lead developer and co-president for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/). 

## 🚀 Projects
I love working on projects that I feel are impactful and that I want to use myself. Here are some of my favorites:

- [**TigerJunction**](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-junction): A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection used by thousands of students.
- [**GenCards**](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/gen-cards): A desktop flashcard application that features a take on spaced repetition that I believe is more human-friendly.
- [**HiraHero**](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/hira-hero): A web-based tool for practicing typing Hiragana.

## 📝 Blog

I write about my experiences in engineering and thoughts on education on my [blog](https://motoaki.dev). Here are some of my latest posts:

## 💻 Technologies & Tools
I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript (usually with Svelte or React for the frontend) and React Native (Expo) for my personal projects, and C and Python for my research. I am familiar with Go, Verilog, Java, MatLab, and ARM Assembly through my coursework. For backend development, I primarily use PostgreSQL for databases and Node.js for the server.
