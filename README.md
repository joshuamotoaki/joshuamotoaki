😊 Hi there! I'm Joshua Motoaki Lau (劉元明), and I'm a 3rd year undergraduate studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University with minors in computer science and german. I research computer networks and security with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/). I also work as co-president and lead developer for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/). 

## 🚀 Projects
My projects are primarily full-stack web development projects. I feel that web development is one of the best ways to reach a lot of people since it's quick to deploy and device agnostic. I seek to make useful projects with highest possible qualtiy. Here are some of my favorites:

- [**TigerJunction**](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-junction): A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection used by thousands of students.
- [**GenCards**](https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/gen-cards): A desktop flashcard application that features a take on spaced repetition that I believe is more human-friendly.
- [**TigerStudy**](https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/tiger-study-2): A simple web app that helps Princeton students find study groups for their courses.

While I primarily make web apps with SvelteKit, I'm interested in all the different technologies out there!
