👋 Hi there! I'm Joshua Lau, and I'm currently studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I research computer networks with Prof. Maria Apostolaki with the [NetSyn Lab](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/), specifically looking into video streaming security. I also work as a developer for [TigerApps](https://tigerapps.org/), maintaining student applications and fostering a student-developer community. 

## 🚀 Projects
- (**TigerJunction**)[https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/TigerJunction]: A full-stack web application for Princeton academic planning and course selection.
- (**UnboundCSE**)[https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/unbound-cse]: A free, online textbook for learning introductory computer science and electrical engineering.
- (**HiraHero**)[https://github.com/joshuamotoaki/hira-hero]: A web-based tool for practicing typing on East Asian language keyboards.
 
## 💻 Technologies & Tools
I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript (usually with Svelte or React for the frontend) and Dart/Flutter for my personal projects, and C and Python for my research. I am familiar with Go, Verilog, Java, MatLab, and ARM Assembly through my coursework. For backend development, I primarily use PostgreSQL for databases and Node.js for the server.
